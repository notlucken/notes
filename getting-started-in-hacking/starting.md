## What is hacking?&#x20;

Hacking refers to using technical knowledge and skills to access systems, networks, or data without proper authorization. This can be done for various reasons, such as testing security, identifying vulnerabilities, or stealing sensitive information.

## Can I learn hacking on my own?&#x20;

Yes, it is possible to learn hacking on your own through online resources, books, and courses. However, it is important to use this knowledge responsibly and ethically, and never engage in unauthorized activities.

## How can I start in hacking?

I started seeing videos of S4vitaar, in [Youtube ](https://www.youtube.com/@s4vitar)and [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/s4vitaar). He's a big inspiration to me, so I follow him in everything he does.

## Can I become a hacker without a degree or formal education?&#x20;

Yes, a formal education is not necessarily required to become a hacker. Many successful hackers have learned their skills through self-study and practice.

## Which system do you recommend to use?

I always will be recommending [Kali](https://kali.org) if you're getting started.\
After that, I recommend [Parrot OS.](https://parrotsec.org)

## What is the difference between pentesting and hacking?&#x20;

Pentesting is an authorized, ethical approach to testing the security of a system or network, with the goal of identifying vulnerabilities that can be remediated before an attacker can exploit them. Hacking, on the other hand, is an unauthorized, illegal approach to accessing systems or networks, with the goal of stealing data, causing damage, or otherwise exploiting the target.

## What are the phases of a pentest?&#x20;

A typical pentest includes the following phases: reconnaissance, scanning, enumeration, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, post-exploitation, and reporting. The specific activities performed during each phase may vary depending on the scope and goals of the test.

## What are some common tools used in pentesting?&#x20;

Some common tools used in pentesting include Nmap, Metasploit, Burp Suite, Wireshark, John the Ripper, and Aircrack-ng. These tools can be used for tasks such as network scanning, vulnerability assessment, password cracking, and traffic analysis.

## Is pentesting legal?&#x20;

Pentesting is legal as long as it is performed with the proper authorization and permissions. Unauthorized hacking or pentesting can result in legal consequences and should never be attempted.

## What are some common vulnerabilities that pentesters look for?&#x20;

Common vulnerabilities that pentesters look for include weak passwords, unpatched software, misconfigured security settings, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), buffer overflows, and authentication bypasses.

## What is the goal of a pentest report?&#x20;

The goal of a pentest report is to provide a detailed account of the testing process, including the vulnerabilities identified, the methods used to exploit them, and recommendations for remediation. The report should be clear, concise, and actionable, with prioritized recommendations based on the severity of the vulnerabilities.
